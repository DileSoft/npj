     PURPOSE: Conditional skipping of template`s parts with recursion available
     SYNTAX:
              {{?IsBig}}  next text to be shown if IsBig != 0
                          there could be a lot of text
              {{?!IsBig}} else this text would be shown
                          if is IsBig == 0. 
                          You could use only {?!...} combination
                          w/o first part.
              {{?/IsBig}} 

            This example suppose $tpl->Assign("IsBig", 1 or 0)

     NB: Recursive including makes this a bit slower. 
         Note that you should use {{??IsBig}}, {{??!IsBig}}, {{??/IsBig}} patterns for recursion if any
         Link "skip_simple" to "?", if you don`t need any recursion.
