"Net Project Journal" (NPJ in acronym) is a distributable collaboration & 
communication system. It provides the abilities to manage content, to supply 
collaboration tools for workteams as well as to be the multiblog engine for 
posting periodic messages to the web. It is based on consolidation of three 
most-used concepts:

    * cms engine - to manage the content of the site in handy manner and/or
    * weblog (multiuser version) - to intercommunicate with each others in community and/or
    * wiki - to collaborate with each other in the team on project-related basis.

Unifying these concepts in a single, easy-to-use, tightly bound environment 
allows workgroups to organize the common workspace with shared artefacts 
(such as documents, posts etc) to work on together.
